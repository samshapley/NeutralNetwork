            "transcript": " The Queen Bufftailed Bumblebee. Wayne just half a gram. It's February, and she's emerging from a six-month hibernation. To make the most of what London has to offer, she must raise her own army of inner city commuters. To do so, she will need to find a base. London is not an easy place to find a home, but luckily there are still a few hidden gems fit for a queen. That's away, dry, and well insulated with plenty of space for growing family. This will do nicely. As the river of daily life continues on London's busy streets, the Queen stays at home. Laying eggs that hatch into grubs, but then emerge as well could be. This is the Queen's army, and it's tasked with a very important mission to find food. On the face of it, a seemingly impossible job in the urban world. But like most cities, hidden away behind London's concrete walls, office blocks and homes. There's a treasure trove of food. The treasure trove of food. Gardens. London is over 3 million of them. They make up nearly a quarter of the city. Many bursting with flowers, full of sugar, rich nectar, just what the bumblebee's need. And all the workers have to do now is find them. Bumblebee's can travel as far as seven miles a day looking for food. That's the equivalent of a human circumnavigating the globe 10 times just to get to the shops and back. If they don't manage to feed every 40 minutes, they risk starvation. They key to the Bumblebee success lies in their ability to navigate the urban world. Like London's legendary cab drivers, they use landmarks to build up a mental map of their surroundings. And using the sun to get their bearings, they can easily find their way to the best flower spots. And the most direct routes to and from them. The industrious army worked day in, day out. And with a work it could be able to carry its own body weight and nectar and pollen back to the nest. The colony goes from strength to strength. In just three months, the queen and her tireless workers have harvested everything they need from London's gardens. With a bountiful food available, an extraordinary ability to find their way around. Bumblebee's we have lost much of their world habitat and are thriving in urban areas."
